# Lab 9 - Dense Neural Network

1. Using Keras Datasets, obtain the fMNIST data set. Explore and describe it as you would do with any new dataset that you start working with (2 points). 
2. Train a dense neural network using Keras, try out at least three hyperparameters configurations (2 points)
3. Evaluate its accuracy for each of the configurations. Choose the best configuration, and: Report its accuracy, confusion metric, and  specific examples of incorrect classification, and drew some conclusions from this exploration (2 points)
